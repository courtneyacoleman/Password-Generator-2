# Password Generator


##  Description

This application allows a user to generate a secure password.  The password can contain 8-128 characters.  The user is able to choose which types of characters they would like the password to include.  

## Deployment
This application is deployed through Github pages and can be found at:
https://courtneyacoleman.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/

## Instructions

Upon opening the application the user is presented with a password generator button.  When they press the button there will be a series of popup boxes.  The first asks for the length of the password. If the input does not meet the criteria they will be alerted and returned to the main screen.  If their input is valid they will receive a series of prompts asking them choose which typres of characters the password should contain.  Those include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.  They are then presented with a password they can copy and paste for their own use.

# Future project improvements

I would like the upgrade the user interface.  Possibly using bootstrap.  I would also like the confirm boxes to display all in one menu.  A user could check which characters they want to use.  I believe this would be easier for the user to understand.
